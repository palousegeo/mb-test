<p>I think this is a no-brainer for most people reading this. I used a PC for my entire working career. The professional software I used for many of those years didn&rsquo;t run on Macs. Later, when I moved on to open source software alternatives, it still worked better on PCs than Macs.</p>
<p>I retired several years ago, and my old PC laptop gave out not long after. Digitally, I have been doing more consumption than creation. I&rsquo;ve had an iPhone for years in large part to stay compatible with my wife (who just wants her tech to work with minimal involvement on her part). I bought an iPad after I retired, and that has been my primary digital device. The iPad is great for reading and watching, but frustrating to type more than a short email. I&rsquo;ll save my experiences with the Apple Pencil for a future post. I do have a nice Windows 10 desktop, but it is older and Microsoft has deemed it unworthy for upgrade. Support for Windows 10 is slated to end later this year.</p>
<p>So why do I want a laptop? I&rsquo;m looking to dust off the web development and python skills I used to have. As a former data science person I would like to investigate the promises and perils of AI on my own. If nothing else I would like to compare notes on this with my grandkids.</p>
<p>I feel like I could do my development work on either platform. I do think that Microsoft&rsquo;s vision for AI Is more developed than Apple&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve been satisfied with my Apple devices and will continue to use them. It is tempting to stay within Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem. It is also clearly the environment of choice within the Micro.blog community where I spend a lot of time these days. It would be nice to be able to relate to the tech posts there.</p>
<p>On the other hand I have 40 years of satisfied experience with Windows (and earlier DOS).</p>
<p>I think it will come down to a snap decision on the day I order.</p>
